Revolver
========

An Elixir HTTP Client with support for HTTP/1.1, SPDY, and WebSocket.

> **WARNING:** This library is not ready for use, so don't use it yet.

The library is an experiment. The goal is to create something that is very
composeable, like [Plug][1]. It will provide adapters for different Erlang
HTTP clients. The first adapter will be for [Gun][2].
